#   😵‍💫 **MyProfile** : some order in this chaos! 

### 🎤 **Who Am I?** I'm only a human after all 🤦‍♂️

Hi! I'm Tiziano and I'm a physics student in university. I've opened this GitHub becouse, recently, I'm working to learn some coding and I want to share some of my training here! I want to learn some python, HTML, C for now but, if i have time in the future, maybe I'm going to work to learn other languages! 

## 🔬 What I'm doing now 

Now I'm in university session and I'm studing nuclar fisics and standard models particle. Also, I'm trying to make a TicTacToe program using some basic rendering.


##  😫 **How have I organized this profile:** 

I noticed that I can't make "folders of repository" and this trigger me (I'm a huge fan of folders). For this, I want to organize my repository a "pre-title" to indicate the type of work done in the repository. Now, the "pre-titles" used are:


- 🐍 **MyPythonStudy**: These repository conetain all my training codes with python.
