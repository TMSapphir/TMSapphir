#   😵‍💫 **MyProfile** : some order in this chaos! 

### 🎤 **Who Am I?** [I'm only a human after all 🤦‍♂️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3wKzyIN1yk)

Hi! I'm Tiziano and I'm a **physics student** in **university**. I've opened this GitHub becouse, recently, I'm working to learn some coding and I want to share some of my training here! I want to learn some python, HTML, C for now but, if i have time in the future, maybe I'm going to work to learn other languages! 

## 🔬 What I'm doing now 

Now I'm in university session and I'm studing **nuclear fisics** and standard models particles. Also, I'm trying to make a **BlackJack program**.

##  🤓 What I Know (Perhaps)

- **Python**(_Training_)
- **Physics**(_Training_)

##  😫 **How have I organized this profile:** 

I noticed that I can't make "folders of repository" and this trigger me (I'm a huge fan of folders). For this, I want to organize my repository a "pre-title" to indicate the type of work done in the repository. Now, the "pre-titles" used are:


- 🐍 **MyPythonJourney**: These repository conetain all my training codes with python.


##  🎧 MyCodingVibe: What i listen when i code

I don't know why, but when I code, I need to listen to certain songs to concentrate. It's strange because normally, when I study university subjects, I need silence. But when I study coding, paradoxically, I can't concentrate without listening to something. Here I'm sharing a playlist of songs I personally find helpful for concentration (don't ask me why these songs in particular. I don't know either).
