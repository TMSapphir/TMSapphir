#   😵‍💫 **MyProfile** : some order in this chaos! 

### 🎤 **Who Am I?** [I'm only a human after all 🤦‍♂️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3wKzyIN1yk)

Hi! I'm Tiziano and I'm a **physics student** in **university**. I've opened this GitHub becouse, recently, I'm working to learn some coding and I want to share some of my training here! I want to learn some python, HTML, C for now but, if i have time in the future, maybe I'm going to work to learn other languages! 

## 🔬 What I'm doing now 

Now I'm in university session and I'm studing **nuclear fisics** and standard models particles. Also, I'm trying to **make Connect 4 with OOP**.

##  🤓 What I Know (Perhaps)

- **Python**(_ForeverInTraining_)
- **Physics**(_ForeverInTraining_)

<!--
Because you never stop to learn something 😜 
-->

##  😫 **How have I organized this profile:** 

I noticed that I can't make "folders of repository" and this trigger me (I'm a huge fan of folders). For this, I want to organize my repository a "pre-title" to indicate the type of work done in the repository. Now, the "pre-titles" used are:


- 🐍 **MyPythonJourney**: These repository conetain all my training codes with python.


<!-- 
For now I'm using only the notepad standard and the IDLE standard. Yeah... the ASCII drawing is made totaly in notepad. I'm stupid? Maybe...maybe...

##  🎧 MyCodingVibe: What i listen when i code

I don't know why, but when I code, I need to listen to certain songs to concentrate. It's strange because normally, when I study university subjects, I need silence. But when I study coding, paradoxically, I can't concentrate without listening to something. Here I'm sharing a playlist of songs I personally find helpful for concentration (don't ask me why these songs in particular. I don't know either).

One of the best discussion about the difference between matematics/logic and physics or, in general, reality

https://youtu.be/B-eh2SD54fM?si=YLGecBkz4b2ZImS5

I'm more in the strumentalist, operational and relational side of the spectrum. I'm not a "realist" if you know what I mean. The physics, for me, don't describe the reality but create predictive models in determinate precisions scale. Logic a tool and a language, not a rappresentation of reality. But here I'm getting phylosofical 🤓🤣

As a physicist, I wonder: why doesn't anyone ask the photon what its point of view is? If I were the photon, I would be offended. 😡

The image's outline, the octahedron, is a reference to the Platonic solid from the anime Alexander: Chronicles of Alexander the Great. After seeing the Macedonians with their Aristotelian mecha soldiers, the Persians with their fire-breathing elephants, and the Pythagorean priest-magicians... I fell in love with it.
